My first notes are about environment setup, and working on Chapter 3 &amp;ldquo;Hello World&amp;rdquo;.
A few tutorials I&amp;rsquo;ve seen use assemblers like FASM or NASM, but the book uses ML64 so that is what I used as well.
Setup To get setup with ML64 the book recommended searching for ml64.exe and adding it to the path.</description></item><item><title>Graphics Dev Journal 1</title><link>https://ninerdelta.com/post/2018/06/27/graphics-dev-journal-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:46:16 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://ninerdelta.com/post/2018/06/27/graphics-dev-journal-1/</guid><description>A Journey Through Space Transformations NOTE: THIS POST CONTAINS MATH ERRORS (12/14/2020)
Say the point p0 is in object space and its coordinates are {0, 2, 0, 1} so just a point on the Y axis.
p0 is placed in world space by a model transformation shown in Figure 1, that is, no rotation, just translated along Z axis by 5 units.
The camera is sitting at the origin of world space but &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo; down the -Z axis, so the camera&amp;rsquo;s location in world space is c0 = {0, 0, 0, 1} and its coordinate system can be represented as shown in Figure 2, and then combining its location and coordinate system into view matrix also shown in Figure 2</description></item></channel></rss>
