Resources ImGui Vulkan + SDL example Sascha Willems Vulkan samples Vulkan Programming Guide API Without Secrets Khronos Notes I&amp;rsquo;m going pretty slow and looking up pretty much every function and struct. It takes a lot of code, and there are a lot of concepts to build up a mental model for. Pipelines, render passes, attachments, queues etc.</description></item><item><title>Graphics Dev Journal 1</title><link>https://www.ninerdelta.com/post/2018/06/27/graphics-dev-journal-1/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jun 2018 19:46:16 -0700</pubDate><guid>https://www.ninerdelta.com/post/2018/06/27/graphics-dev-journal-1/</guid><description>A Journey Through Space Transformations NOTE: THIS POST CONTAINS MATH ERRORS (12/14/2020)
Say the point p0 is in object space and its coordinates are {0, 2, 0, 1} so just a point on the Y axis.
p0 is placed in world space by a model transformation shown in Figure 1, that is, no rotation, just translated along Z axis by 5 units.
The camera is sitting at the origin of world space but &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo; down the -Z axis, so the camera&amp;rsquo;s location in world space is c0 = {0, 0, 0, 1} and its coordinate system can be represented as shown in Figure 2, and then combining its location and coordinate system into view matrix also shown in Figure 2</description></item></channel></rss>
