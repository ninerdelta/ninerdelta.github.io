Say the point p0 is in object space and its coordinates are {0, 2, 0, 1} so just a point on the Y axis.
p0 is placed in world space by a model transformation shown in Figure 1, that is, no rotation, just translated along Z axis by 5 units.
The camera is sitting at the origin of world space but &amp;ldquo;looking&amp;rdquo; down the -Z axis, so the camera&amp;rsquo;s location in world space is c0 = {0, 0, 0, 1} and its coordinate system can be represented as shown in Figure 2, and then combining its location and coordinate system into view matrix also shown in Figure 2</description></item></channel></rss>
